# Dominion RCV Results Reporter

A Python script to generate HTML snippets of the round-by-round results
of ranked choice voting (RCV) contests from the results reports generated
by Dominion's Democracy Suite.

The script parses both the XML and Excel (`.xlsx`) reports output by
the Dominion system.

## Overview

This project enables the round-by-round results of RCV contests to be
displayed as part of an HTML election results summary page for several
contests.

For example, the RCV contest for District Attorney in San Francisco's
November 2022 election might look like this.

RCV contest, as generated by this
project](docs/images/2022-11-DA-Summary.png)

Notice in the example above that both the first and final rounds are shown,
and the leading candidate (and their final-round vote total) is
highlighted in green.
The final round is the most important round to show because it shows which
candidate is leading.

## Advantages

Some advantages:

* HTML is more accessible than Dominion's PDF reports.
* The HTML generated by this project can be made to support multiple
  languages, as well as customized in other ways to increase accessibility,
  readability, and convenience.
* Using HTML snippets lets the results of multiple RCV contests be
  viewed on a single page. This way members of the public don't need to
  click to a different page for each RCV contest.
* The tables in Dominion's PDF reports can also be inconveniently split
  by page breaks, which makes them harder to read. For example, this can
  be seen in the screenshot below of a PDF report from the November 2022
  election:

## Requirements

This project is intended for use with Dominion's Democracy Suite 5.10A.
This is the Dominion voting system that the [California Secretary of State
approved](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ovsta/frequently-requested-information/dominion-voting)
in July 2020 (with approvals of subsequent modifications in 2021 and later).

## Setup

Install Python.

Install Python requirements and the project itself (preferably within
a Python virtual environment):

```
$ pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```
$ python src/rcvresults/main.py
```

TODO

## Developing

To run tests:

```
$ python -m unittest discover rcvresults
```

"Tidied" versions of the HTML files in the `html` directory were generated
using HTML [Tidy](https://www.html-tidy.org/).

For example:

```
$ tidy -output html/2020-11-03/index-tidied.html -utf8 html/2020-11-03/index-original.html
```

## TODO

* Start adding other languages?
* Make test HTML viewable on GitHub.
* Add end-to-end tests of the html.
* Make sure all elections are covered in the tests.
* Add intermediate rounds? (expand / collapse)
