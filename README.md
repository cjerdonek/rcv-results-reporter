# Dominion RCV Results Reporter

Generate HTML ranked choice voting (RCV) results pages from the
Excel (xlsx) or XML results reports generated by the Dominion voting system.

## Overview

This project enables the round-by-round results of RCV contests to be
displayed as part of an HTML election results summary page for several
contests.

For example, using San Francisco's November 2022 election as an example,
the RCV contest for the District Attorney might look like this.

RCV contest, as generated by this
project](docs/images/2022-11-DA-Summary.png)

Notice in the example above that both the first and final rounds are shown,
and the leading candidate is highlighted in green.
The final round is the most important round because it shows which
candidate is leading.

## Requirements

This project is intended for use with Dominion's Democracy Suite 5.10A.
This is the Dominion voting system that the [California Secretary of State
approved](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ovsta/frequently-requested-information/dominion-voting)
in July 2020 (with approvals of subsequent modifications in 2021 and later).

## Usage

TODO

## Developing

To run tests:

```
$ python -m unittest discover rcvresults
```

"Tidied" versions of the HTML files in the `html` directory were generated
using HTML [Tidy](https://www.html-tidy.org/).

For example:

```
$ tidy -output html/2020-11-03/index-tidied.html -utf8 html/2020-11-03/index-original.html
```

## TODO

* Support parsing XML.
* Make test HTML viewable on GitHub.
* Add end-to-end tests of the html.
* Add intermediate rounds? (expand / collapse)
